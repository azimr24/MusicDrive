# Music Drive

## Description
Music Drive is a simple music player that plays music directly from Google Drive using the Google Drive API for file storage and the expo-av Javascript library for audio playback handling. This project aims to provide users with an accessible and easy-to-use interface to manage and listen to their music stored in Google Drive as an alalternative to music streaming services behind paywalls.

## Current Features
- **Album and Playlist Libraries**: Easily browse and manage your albums and playlists.
- **Playback Controls**: Play, Pause, Next, Previous, and Seek through tracks.
- **Recently Played**: Access tracks you've recently listened to for quick playback.
- **Shuffle and Repeat**: Enhance playback by shuffling songs or repeating your favorite tracks.
- **Background Playback**: Continue listening to music even when the app is in the background.
- **Queue Management**: Manage your upcoming songs with a queue system.
- **Google Drive Sign In**: Securely log in via Google to access your music files.

## To Be Implemented
- **Robust Error Handling**: Ensure the app gracefully handles and recovers from errors.
- **Sign Out/Switch Accounts**: Allow users to sign out or switch between different Google accounts.
- **Animations**: Possibly add animations for a smoother and more visually appealing interface.

## Notes
- A google cloud project is required to use the Google Drive API. You can create one [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/) as you require a client ID (and its reverse) to authenticate with Google in Info.plist and GoogleService-Info.plist
